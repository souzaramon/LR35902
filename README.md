## SM83 (aka the GameBoy CPU)

> The implementation of the SM83 CPU in Go, primarily for learning purposes. This is a standalone project because I’m still unsure what I’ll use it for.

### History

The SM83 CPU is the custom processor used in the Nintendo Game Boy and its successor, the Game Boy Color. It is a hybrid CPU that combines elements of the Zilog Z80 and the Intel 8080, but it is not identical to either. The `SM83` CPU was used in:

- Nintendo Game Boy (DMG-01)
- Nintendo Game Boy Pocket
- Nintendo Game Boy Light (Japan Only)
- Nintendo Game Boy Color (CGB-001)
- Game Boy Printer
